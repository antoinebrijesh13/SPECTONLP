  ((dw.is_DiscPresent == IN_NO_ACTIVE_CHILD) && ((99 > dw.temporalCounter_i1) || !(dw.is_c4_model == IN_Inserting))) -> (rtDW.is_DiscPresent == IN_NO_ACTIVE_CHILD)

  This logical statement describes a condition under which the system's `is_DiscPresent` status *remains* or is confirmed as `IN_NO_ACTIVE_CHILD` (meaning no active disc is recognized). It does not define how the system *enters* this state.

  The statement dictates that:
**"If the system's internal Disc Present status is currently 'No Active Child', AND (either a specific internal timer (`temporalCounter_i1`) is less than 99, OR the 'c4_model' state machine is NOT in its 'Inserting' state), THEN the runtime Disc Present status will be 'No Active Child'."**

  More precisely, this condition holds true if:
  1.  **`dw.is_DiscPresent == IN_NO_ACTIVE_CHILD`**: The system's current internal belief is that no disc is active or present.
  2.  **`&&` (AND)**: This must be combined with the following complex condition.
  3.  **`((99 > dw.temporalCounter_i1) || !(dw.is_c4_model == IN_Inserting))`**: One of the following two sub-conditions must be true:
    *   **`99 > dw.temporalCounter_i1`**: A specific system timer (`temporalCounter_i1`) has not yet reached a value of 99. This could represent a short grace period or a timeout not yet elapsed.
    *   **`||` (OR)**: This allows either of the two sub-conditions to be true.
    *   **`!(dw.is_c4_model == IN_Inserting)`**: The state machine for `c4_model` (likely related to a specific disc type or mechanism) is *not* currently in its `IN_Inserting` state. This means a disc insertion process for that model is either not active or has completed.

  If all these conditions on the left side of the implication (`->`) are met, then the system's runtime `is_DiscPresent` status (`rtDW.is_DiscPresent`) is confirmed as `IN_NO_ACTIVE_CHILD`. This rule ensures that the "no active disc" state persists unless a disc insertion *is* in progress for the `c4_model` AND the timer has exceeded 99, or if the initial `dw.is_DiscPresent` state changes.
