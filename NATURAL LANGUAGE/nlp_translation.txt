FINAL TRANSLATION
================

  This logical statement defines the conditions under which the system's `is_DiscPresent` status *remains* as `IN_NO_ACTIVE_CHILD` (indicating no active disc is currently present or being processed). It does not specify how the system initially transitions *into* this state.

  The system will maintain the `IN_NO_ACTIVE_CHILD` status if **all** of the following conditions are met:

  1.  **Current Disc State:** The system's current state for disc presence (`dw.is_DiscPresent`) is already `IN_NO_ACTIVE_CHILD`.
  2.  **Transitional or Operational State Check:** One of the following two sub-conditions must be true:
    *   **Temporal Counter Condition:** The internal temporal counter `dw.temporalCounter_i1` has a value less than 99. This often signifies that a specific delay or grace period has not yet fully elapsed.
    *   **Insertion State Condition:** The `c4_model` state is *not* `IN_Inserting`. This ensures the system is not actively engaged in the process of inserting a disc.

  In summary, if the system currently reports no active disc, and it is either within a defined temporal window or not actively performing a disc insertion, then the `is_DiscPresent` status will continue to be `IN_NO_ACTIVE_CHILD`. This rule helps stabilize the 'no disc' state under specific operational and temporal constraints, preventing premature state changes.
