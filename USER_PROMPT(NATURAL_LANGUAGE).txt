Guideline for Natural Language Specification:
1.the Logical Statement:
{logical_statement}

2. Step 1: Logical Decomposition
o Expert A (Simplified Language):
  Role: Provide an initial breakdown in simplified terms, focusing on
  clarity and understanding.
  Focus: Break down the logical statement into manageable conditions
  while retaining the core meaning.
  Simplified Translation: Identify the core conditions (such as modes,
  states, inputs) and break them into key criteria for the transition.

o Expert B (Technical Precision):
  Role: Translate the statement using technical terminology and ensure
  accuracy in logical expressions.
  Focus: Use precise language to explain the conditions without
  oversimplifying.
  Precise Translation: Define the conditions and logical relationships
  (AND, OR, NOT) explicitly with accurate terminology and variable
  names.

o Expert C (Contextual Example):
  Role: Use real-world analogies or contextual explanations to clarify
  the system's behavior for technical users.
  Focus: Provide relevant analogies that align with technical scenarios,
  but without oversimplifying.
  Contextual Example: Provide relatable comparisons to real-world
  systems (e.g., decision-making processes, system transitions) to clarify
  the conditions, without reducing the complexity of the logic.

3. Step 2: Refining the Explanation
o Expert A (Simplified Language):
  Role: Organize the conditions into clear steps, using simple language.
  Focus: Break the logic down into digestible parts while preserving key
  technical details.
  Simplified Explanation: Clearly list out the conditions that must be
  met for the transition, using straightforward language and bullet points
  for ease of understanding.

o Expert B (Technical Precision):
  Role: Ensure the translation is technically precise, using consistent
  terms and logical operators.
  Focus: Ensure all logical operators and conditions are clearly
  explained using proper technical terminology.
  Refined Technical Explanation: Present the explanation with a focus
  on accuracy, where each condition is listed clearly, ensuring all
  technical variables and their relationships are intact.

o Expert C (Contextual Example):
  Role: Refine the example or analogy to ensure it remains relevant,
  accurate, and helpful.
  Focus: Provide an example that aligns with the technical scenario,
  ensuring the analogy helps clarify the logic.
  Contextual Example: Provide a more concise, yet accurate example
  that mirrors the technical scenario and simplifies the understanding of
  the system's transitions.

4. Step 3: Final Combined Result
o Combined Result:
  Include the logical statement in the begining
  Role: Combine all insights from the previous steps into a final refined
  translation.
  Focus: The final translation should be clear, precise, and concise,
  ensuring the explanation is suitable for a technical audience.
  Final Combined Translation: Provide a final cohesive explanation,
  ensuring that all key technical details, conditions, and relationships are
  presented clearly. List conditions as needed and provide an overview
  of how they interrelate.
